# Introduction 
Empty Desk Project The purpose of this project is to measure the amount of time employees' desks are empty. The first version of this project was written by Mrs. Ezzati. Limitations related to the project carried out by Mrs. Ezzati: 
1- The need to record the coordinates of each table manually 
2- The ability to identify faces only from profile and three-sided modes 
3- The sensitivity of the camera angle 
4- Problems related to the estimation of the threshold size For tall people, according to the mentioned restrictions, the new project has been designed by me to remove the mentioned restrictions. 

There are multiple branches: the first folder is related to the source codes of Ms. Ezzati and the second folder is related to the source codes of me, Amir Ali Nasimi.

# Getting Started
There are 2 types of algorithms in Src, namely Main Algorithms and Other Algorithms. The Main_Algorithms contains 2 versions developed by Holoo developer where as in Other_Algorithms youll find multiple algorithms to detect tables, chairs, etc. To run each please visit each directory. the Algorithms are as follow:

## Main Algorithms
**[1. ver 1.0](./0_Main_Algorithm_ver_1_0/empty_table-121.ipynb)**

**[2. ver 1.1](./0_Main_Algorithm_ver_1_1/Empty%20Table.ipynb)**

**[3. ver 1.2](./0_Main_Algorithm_ver_1_2/Empty%20Table.ipynb)**

**[4. ver 1.3](./0_Main_Algorithm_ver_1_3/Empty%20Table.ipynb)**

**[5. ver 2.3](./0_Main_Algorithm_ver_2_3/Empty%20Table.ipynb)**

## Other Algorithms
**[1. Indoor Object Detection](./Src/1.IndoorObjectDetection/)**

**[2. Indoor Object Detecttion - Second Version](./Src/2.Indoor-Object-Detection/)**
